Here are the total explanation about how to run our code correctly for task 1 to task 4.

Task 1:





Task 2:

Defuant model

Introduction:
This is a simple model to simulate the opinion dynamics among individuals. In this model, you can have a look about the trend that the opinion gradually concentrates together, showing the impact between people.

Dependencies:
-Numpy
-Random
-Argparse
-Matplotlib.pyplot

Usage:
You can run my model by typing this in terminal:
Python Task2.py -defuant -beta[value] -threshold[value]

Here are also four flags you can use here:
1.-beta: default number is 0.2 
2.-Threshold: default number is 0.2
3.-defuant: [You can run this with default beta and threshold value]
4.-test_defuant:[You can test the function with different parameters for beta and threshold]




Task 3:




Task 4:
